1. Your team is planning to migrate an existing monolithic application to Kubernetes. How would you design the Kubernetes infrastructure to accommodate this migration?
1. You've noticed that some Pods in your cluster are frequently being evicted due to resource constraints. How would you identify the root cause and optimize resource allocation?
1. A critical Pod is failing to start in your production cluster. Explain your troubleshooting process and how you would minimize downtime.
1. Your organization wants to isolate different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) within the same Kubernetes cluster. What strategies would you use to achieve this?
1. You need to implement a zero-downtime update for an application with multiple microservices. How would you orchestrate this rolling update in Kubernetes?
1. You are working on a multi-cloud Kubernetes deployment. How would you configure network policies to ensure secure communication between Pods across different cloud providers?
1. Your application requires HTTPS access through an Ingress Controller. Explain how you would set up SSL termination and routing in Kubernetes.
1. Your team is migrating an application that relies on a Layer 4 load balancer to Kubernetes. Explain how you would set up external load balancing for the application.

1. You have a database application that requires persistent storage. How would you design and manage storage for this stateful application in Kubernetes?
1. The storage backend for your Persistent Volumes (PVs) is running out of space. How would you dynamically provision additional storage for your PVs?
1. Describe your approach to ensure data consistency and reliability for stateful applications running in Kubernetes.
1. Your team is responsible for maintaining compliance in a regulated industry. How would you ensure Kubernetes cluster compliance with industry standards?
1. A critical application is experiencing high CPU utilization in a Kubernetes cluster. How would you identify the resource-intensive Pods and optimize resource allocation?
1. A Pod's readiness probe keeps failing. How would you investigate and resolve this issue while ensuring high availability?
1. Describe your approach to monitoring Kubernetes clusters for potential issues and performance bottlenecks.
1. Your organization has a microservices-based application with complex dependencies. How do you troubleshoot issues related to service discovery and communication?
1. You are tasked with setting up Kubernetes cluster auto-scaling based on resource utilization metrics. How would you implement this?
1. Your team wants to package and distribute Kubernetes applications using Helm. How would you create and manage Helm charts for your applications?
1. You are managing a large-scale Kubernetes deployment with many custom resources. How would you organize and manage these resources effectively?
1. Explain how you would use Kubernetes Operators to automate complex application deployments and management tasks.
1. Your organization is adopting a multi-cluster strategy. How would you set up a central control plane to manage and federate multiple Kubernetes clusters?
1. Describe your experience with using Kubernetes-deployment CI/CD.
1. You are responsible for maintaining a library of reusable Helm charts. How do you version and distribute these charts within your organization?
1. Your organization is considering adopting Kubernetes on a hybrid cloud infrastructure. How would you design a hybrid Kubernetes deployment?
1. Your team is planning to perform a major Kubernetes version upgrade. How would you plan and execute the upgrade with minimal disruption to existing applications?
1. A critical application in your production cluster has been compromised. Describe the steps you would take to respond to the incident and recover.
1. Your Kubernetes cluster is experiencing a sudden spike in traffic. How would you ensure that the cluster scales dynamically to handle the increased load?
1. Describe the process of implementing canary deployments for a critical application in your Kubernetes environment, including rollback strategies.
1. Explain how you would implement a blue-green deployment strategy for a mission-critical application in Kubernetes, including rollback plans in case of issues.
